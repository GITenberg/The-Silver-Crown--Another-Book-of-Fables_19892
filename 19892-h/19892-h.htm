<p>"And shall I be a king?" asked the child, "and shall I wear a crown?"</p>

<p>"You shall surely wear a crown," said the Angel, "and a kingdom is
waiting for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, joy!" said the child. "But tell me, how will it come about? for now
I am only a little child, and the crown would hardly stay on my curls."</p>

<p>"Nay! that I may not tell," said the Angel. "Only ride and run your
best, for the way is long to your kingdom, and the time short."</p>

<p>So the child rode and ran his best, crossing hills and valleys, broad
streams and foaming torrents. Here and there he saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span> people at work or
at play, and on these he looked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, when they see me," he said, "they will run to meet me, and
will crown me with a golden crown, and lead me to their palace and
throne me there as king!"</p>

<p>But the folk were all busy with their tasks or their sport, and none
heeded him, or left their business for him; and still he must fare
forward alone, for the Way called him.</p>

<p>Also, he came upon many travellers like himself, some coming toward him,
others passing him by. On these, too, he looked earnestly, and would
stop now one, now another, and question him.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he asked, "of any kingdom in these parts where the crown
is ready and the folk wait for a king?"</p>

<p>Then one would laugh, and another weep, and another jeer, but all alike
shook their heads.</p>

<p>"I am seeking crown and kingdom for myself," cried one; "is it likely
that I can be finding one for you, too? Each one for himself, and the
Way for all!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>

<p>Another said: "You seek in vain. There are no crowns, only fools' caps
with asses' ears and bells that jingle in them."</p>

<p>But others, and these they who had been longest on the way, only looked
on him, some sadly, some kindly, and made no answer; and still he fared
onward, for the Way called him.</p>

<p>Now and then he stopped to help some poor soul who had fallen into
trouble, and when he did that the way lightened before him, and he felt
the heart light within him; but at other times the hurry was strong on
him, so that he would turn away his face, and shut his ears to the cries
that rang in them; and when he did that, the way darkened, and
oftentimes he stumbled himself, and fell into pits and quagmires, and
must cry for help, sometimes on those to whom he had refused it.</p>

<p>By and by he forgot about the crown and the kingdom; or if he thought of
them, it was but as a far-off dream of dim gold, such as one sees at
morning when the sun breaks through the mist. But still he knew that the
way was long and the time short, and still he rode and ran his best.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>At the last he was very weary, and his feet could carry him no further,
when, looking up, he saw that the way came to an end before him, and
there was a gate, and one in white sitting by it, who beckoned to him.
Trembling, yet glad, the child drew near, and knew the Angel who had
spoken to him at the beginning.</p>

<p>"Welcome!" said the Angel, "you come in good time. And what of the Way?"</p>

<p>"I came as fast as I could," said the child, "but many things hindered
me, and now I am weary, and can go no further."</p>

<p>"But what did you find on the way?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"Oh! I found joy and sorrow," said the child, "good measure of both; but
never a crown, such as you promised me, and never a kingdom."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, foolish child," said the Angel. "You are wearing your crown.
It is of purest silver, and shines like white frost; and as for your
kingdom, the name of it is Rest, and here the entrance to it."</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a Grumpy Saint, who thought that all the
world were sinners, himself included. He lived in a little cabin by the
roadside, and his life was a burden to him on account of the passers-by.</p>

<p>They gave him no peace. Now it was a poor man asking for food.</p>

<p>"Go along with you!" said the Grumpy Saint. "It is an abomination to
feed sturdy beggars like you."</p>

<p>And he gave the man his dinner, and went hungry.</p>

<p>Again, it was an old woman, creeping along the road, bent double under a
heavy burden.</p>

<p>"Shame on you!" said the Grumpy Saint. "Why are you not at home,
tending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span> your fire, instead of gadding along the road in this fashion?"</p>

<p>And he took the burden, and carried it all the way to the woman's house,
and came back grumbling.</p>

<p>Still again it was a child, who had lost its way and came crying to his
door.</p>

<p>"Please take me home!" said the child.</p>

<p>"You should not have come out!" said the Saint. "Where is your home?"</p>

<p>"Miles away!" said the child. "And I am tired; please carry me!"</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense!" said the Saint. "Don't talk to me!"</p>

<p>And he wrapped the child in his own coat (for it was winter), and
carried him miles through the snow to his home; and then trudged back
again, but without the coat, for the folk were poor.</p>

<p>And so it went on.</p>

<p>One day the Grumpy Saint died, and went to Heaven, a place in which he
had never believed. As he entered that country, the first person he met
was an Angel, with a bright gold aureole round her head, and in her hand
a staff of lilies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<p>"Welcome!" said the Angel. "Welcome, dear and great saint! I am sent to
greet you, and lead you to the feast that is making in your honor."</p>

<p>"Some mistake!" said the Grumpy Saint. "I don't know what you are
talking about, and I don't like play-acting. What place is this?"</p>

<p>"This is Heaven!" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said the Saint. "I don't believe in Heaven."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you <i>are</i> in it," said the Angel, "which is of more
consequence."</p>

<p>"And who may you be?" asked the Saint. "I seem to know your face."</p>

<p>"Yes!" said the Angel. "I am the old woman you helped with the burden;
don't you remember? the rest are waiting inside, all the people whom you
loved and helped. Come with me!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you are talking about!" said the Saint. "But if I am
to go with you, first take off that ridiculous object on your head! I
don't like play-acting, I tell you, and I have never believed in this
kind of thing."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<p>The Angel smiled; and leading him to a clear pool that lay beside the
road, bade him look in. He looked, and saw two white-clad figures
bending over the water, and round the head of each the shining circle.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul!" cried the Grumpy Saint. "I've got one too!"</p>

<p>"To be sure!" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Preposterous!" said the Grumpy Saint.</p>

<p>One day Love went to and fro in his house, looked from door and window,
and had no rest.</p>

<p>"I am weary," he said, "of this little house. Strait are the walls of
it, and narrow the windows, and from them always the same things to see.
I must be free; I must fly, or of what use are my wings?"</p>

<p>So he took his red robe about him and flew out, leaving door and window
streaming wide to the cold wind.</p>

<p>But when he was gone came one in a little gown of green, (green for
hope, Sweetheart; green for hope!) and entered the house, and shut door
and window; swept the hearth clean and mended the fire, and then set
herself down and sang, and minded her seam. Ever when the flame burned
low she built it up, and now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span> and then she looked out of window to see
if any one were coming; but mostly she sat and sang, and kept the house
tidy and warm.</p>

<p>Now by and by Love was weary with flying hither and yon; cold he was,
too, and night coming on; and as the dusk fell, he saw a light shining
bright on the edge of the wold.</p>

<p>"Where there is light there will be warmth!" said Love; and he flew
near, and saw that it was his own little house.</p>

<p>"Oh! who keeps my house alight?" cried Love.</p>

<p>He opened the door, and the air came warm to greet him.</p>

<p>"Oh! who keeps my house warm?" cried Love. And he looked, and saw one in
a little gown of green, (green for hope, Sweetheart; oh! green for
hope!) mending the fire, and singing as she worked.</p>

<p>"Who are you, who keep my house?" asked Love.</p>

<p>"Kindness is my name!" said the little housekeeper.</p>

<p>"Outside it is cold and empty," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span> Love, "and the wind blows over the
waste; may I come in and warm me by the fire?"</p>

<p>"Oh! and welcome!" said Kindness. "It was for you I kept it."</p>

<p>"My red robe is torn and draggled," said Love. "May I wrap me in the
gown you are making?"</p>

<p>"Oh! and welcome," said Kindness. "It is for you it was making, and now
it is finished."</p>

<p>Love bent over the fire and warmed his poor cold hands.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he cried; "now that I am back in my house I would never leave it
again. But what of my wings, lest they put the flight in me once more?"</p>

<p>"Suppose I clip them," said Kindness, "with my little scissors!"</p>

<p>"How are your scissors called, dear?"</p>

<p>"Peace-and-Comfort is their name!" said Kindness.</p>

<p>So Kindness clipped the wings of Love; and this one swept the hearth,
and that one mended the fire, and all went well while they kept the
house together.</p>

<p>The high Fates sat weaving, weaving at their loom, and I, poor soul,
came crying at the door, asking a boon at their hands.</p>

<p>Those great ladies did not turn their heads, nor stint the flying
shuttle; but one of them spoke, and she the youngest, and her voice was
like the wind over the sea.</p>

<p>"What would you?" she said.</p>

<p>And I said, "That which you had of me yesterday."</p>

<p>"Is it your sin, that turned your cup blood red?"</p>

<p>"Nay; for I drained the cup, and washed it clean with my tears."</p>

<p>"Is it your sorrow, that changed the green world to black about you?"</p>

<p>"Nay; for I wrapped me in it as in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span> mantle, and now I should go cold
without it."</p>

<p>"What then?" she asked; and ever as she spoke, back and forth, back and
forth, the shuttle flew.</p>

<p>"Oh, what but my blunder! when I would make a path for my Love's white
feet, and set instead a snare for them, to her hurt?"</p>

<p>Then those high ladies spoke all together; cold, sweet, steadfast were
the voices of them, and the shuttle humming through.</p>

<p>"Even now the shuttle is threaded with your fault, and naught may stay
its way. Go, poor soul, empty and crying as you came; yet take one
comfort with you. Even of this, even of this, the Web had need!"</p>

<p>"When you come to the city, seek out the House of Wisdom, for it is the
best house, and there you shall do well."</p>

<p>That was what the old people said to the boy when he started on his
journey, and he kept the saying well in mind.</p>

<p>"How shall I know the house?" he had asked them; and they answered, "By
the look of the steps before the door, and by the number of people who
go in and out. More we may not tell you."</p>

<p>The boy pondered these sayings as he journeyed.</p>

<p>"It will be a fine house, no doubt," he said. "I shall know it by its
size and splendor; but as for what they said of the steps, I make little
of that part."</p>

<p>By and by he came to the city, and looked about him eagerly for the
House of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span> Wisdom. Presently, on his right, he saw a house of plain yet
stately aspect. Clear were its windows and high, and from one a face
looked at him of a reverend man, calm and kind.</p>

<p>"Might that be Wisdom?" thought the boy. Then he looked at the steps,
and saw them high and steep, and shining white, as if they had little
use. The door stood open wide, but few came or went through it.</p>

<p>"This cannot be the House of Wisdom!" said the boy. "I must seek
farther."</p>

<p>So he went farther. And presently he saw on his left a house rich and
gay of aspect, shining with gold, and all the windows flung up to the
air; and from one window a face of a fair woman laughed on him, and
beckoned, and waved a tinsel scarf with bells that tinkled sweetly on
his ear.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the boy, "if this might but be the House of Wisdom! but what
of the steps before the door?"</p>

<p>He looked at the steps; and they were wide and shallow, and trodden into
holes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span> and valleys by many feet; and up those steps, and through the
open door, a throng was constantly passing, laughing and singing, and
pelting one another with flowers and spangles.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the boy, "this is, indeed, the House of Wisdom! for true it
is that I can tell by the steps, and by the people who go in and out."</p>

<p>And he entered the House of Folly.</p>

as separate entities?"</p>

<p>"Precisely!" said the Wandering Magician.</p>

<p>The man looked in the glass.</p>

<p>"Here I see several beings!" he said. "Some of them are
distinguished-looking, that one on horseback, for example, and the one
with the lyre. But others have a frivolous air, and there is one with
positively a low expression; and yet he is attractive too, when I look
closer, and I seem to know him. What are these creatures?"</p>

refined. But whom have we here? what strange pigmies are these?"</p>

makes them so small?"</p>

<p>"But they are pretty!" said the man. "Beautiful, I may say. That little
fellow with the twinkle in his eye and his coat out at elbows; he is
charming, if I do say it. But what is going on now? here comes a crowd
of big, hulking, ruffianly fellows, jostling the little people and
driving them to the wall. What a villainous-looking set! Their faces are

<p>The shaded room was still; the doctor and the nurse sat watching by the
bedside; the firelight crept into the corners and whispered to the
shadows: there was no other sound.</p>

<p>"You think you are ready to go?" asked the Angel-who-attends-to-things.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said the man. "I have drained the Cup from brim to bitter lees; I
have read the Book from cover to cover. I am ready."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the Angel-who-attends-to-things. "Well, come along!" and
he led the man out, but did not shut the door after him.</p>

<p>The man had lived in state and splendor, and he had thought that some
ceremony would attend his departure, but there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span> nothing of the sort.
The only change was, that as he went along the Angel seemed to be
growing very tall, and he very little, so that he had to reach up to
hold the strong white hand, and his feet were well-nigh taken from under
him by the sweep of the great white robes; also he felt afraid and
foolish, he knew not why.</p>

<p>So they came at last to a gate, through which many children were passing
with glad faces, carrying tablets of amber and pearl; and beside the
gate sat another Angel, writing in a book; and when a child passed in,
this Angel nodded and smiled to him, and wrote a word in his book.</p>

<p>Now the Angel of the Gate looked up, and saw the
Angel-who-attends-to-things, and beside him the man, holding fast to his
hand, and feeling afraid and foolish.</p>

<p>"From the Primary Department?" asked the Angel of the Gate.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said the other, who never wasted words.</p>

<p>The Angel of the Gate looked the man over carefully. "His hands are
dirty!" he said at length.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes!" said the Angel-who-attends-to-things; "he has not learned to keep
them clean."</p>

<p>"And there is mud on his feet!"</p>

<p>"Yes, he will walk in the mire."</p>

<p>"And his clothes are torn, and stained with blood."</p>

<p>"Yes, he has been quarrelling with his brother and beating him."</p>

<p>At this the man found his voice and cried out, though he felt more
afraid and foolish than ever, and his voice sounded high and thin, like
that of a tiny child.</p>

<p>"I have no brother!" said the man.</p>

<p>The two Angels looked at each other.</p>

<p>"You see!" said the Angel-who-attends-to-things. "I knew how it would
be."</p>

<p>Then he turned to the man. "Run along back," he said, "and try to do
better next time. I left the door open for you."</p>

<p>And in the shaded room, while the firelight whispered to the shadows in
the corners, the doctor rose from the bedside, and spoke softly to the
nurse.</p>

<p>"The crisis is past," he said, "he will live."</p>

<p>When the youth started, he passed through the Forbidden Wood, and
wandered there, plucking and tasting the fruit, smelling the flowers,
evil and sweet; and as he plucked and smelled, it chanced that a thorn
entered his breast, for it lay open. He took little heed, for he was
young, and the life strong in him; so the thorn made its way in, and
presently was buried in the flesh; and he forgot it, for it gave him no
hurt.</p>

<p>By and by he came out of that wood, and shook the dust of it from his
feet, and set his face toward the mountains, for a voice told him that
there he should find his life and his Love. And so it fell, for as he
fared on, his Love came to meet him, and he knew her, and she him. Then
each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span> held out arms of longing, and embraced the other tenderly,
speaking fond words; but when the maiden pressed her arms about the man,
a pang shot through his breast, bitter as death; and he trembled, for he
knew it for the piercing of the thorn.</p>

<p>The man set his teeth, that he might make no outcry, and then he looked
at his Love: and see! she was snow-pale, and held her heart with both
hands, as if in pain.</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried the man. "What hurts my Love?" and she answered, "I
know not; a pang shot through my heart, bitter as death."</p>

<p>"Oh, Love, what like was the pang?" cried the man; and heard her words
before she spoke; for she said, "Like the piercing of a thorn!"</p>

<p>"Must I tell you?" she cried. "It is she who should have been your
mother, and she would not."</p>

asked.</p>

<p>When the Little Sister went away, it was in such haste that she left her
convent robes behind; and this troubled her so that she spoke of it to
the Angel at the Gate. "You see," she said, "I had no idea that I was
coming; I fell asleep in my cell, and woke up in this beautiful homelike
place. But these white garments are not suitable for me; could I find a
black robe, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh no!" said the Angel; "we all wear white here, and it is so much
prettier and more becoming. Besides, you must make haste, for they have
been waiting long for you."</p>

<p>"Who have been waiting?" asked the Little Sister in wonder.</p>

band, little children and older ones, with floating locks and starry
eyes, and all the eyes fixed on her with looks of love, and all the arms
stretched out to her with gestures of longing.</p>

<p>"Oh, the darling, darling children!" cried the Little Sister. "Oh, the
little angels! Now I know that this is heaven indeed."</p>

<p>She fell on her knees, and the children clustered round her, caressing
her, and murmuring sweet words in her ear; and all in a moment the
hunger that had been at her heart through the years was stilled, and she
opened her arms and gathered the children to her breast and wept; happy
tears were those!</p>

<p>"Sweethearts," cried the Little Sister; "dear loves, tell me, whose

some children were making ready a feast for him. They strewed sweet
flowers, and lighted the candles, and made ready the table, white and
fair, with the gold and silver service.</p>

for a cloth, and a third plucked the wild strawberries that shone like

<p>A child found in its garden a plant. Fair and stately it was, full of
rosy buds, with green leaves strong and luminous. The child admired it
greatly.</p>

<p>"How fair it is!" he said. "How full of light and fragrance! but how
does it grow? One should know that."</p>

<p>He looked down, and saw that the plant came up out of the ground.</p>

<p>"This is strange!" he said. "How should so fair a thing come up out of
this black and dirty soil? I must look to this!"</p>

<p>He dug away the soil, and found the roots of the plant, bare and
twisted, clinging to the soil and dark with the touch of it.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the child, "this is terrible. Has that fair crown of rose and
green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span> drawn its life from so foul a source as this? Oh, sorrow and
shame!" and he wept, and wrung his hands.</p>

<p>As he sorrowed, the Angel of the Garden passed by, with her arms full of
flowers and fruit.</p>

<p>"Little one," she said, "have you anything for me?"</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the child. "Look! I had this fair plant, the sweetest in
the world, but I find that its life grows out of the black and ugly
mould; its roots are black with it. Look! the flower begins to droop!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Angel. "Oh, the pity! you have killed it."</p>

<p>In the early morning, when the dew was bright on the grass, a child
passed along the highway, and sang as he went. It was spring, and the
ferns were unrolling their green bundles, and the hepatica showed purple
under her gray fur. The child looked about him with eager, happy eyes,
rejoicing in all he saw, and answering the birds' songs with notes as
gay as their own. Now and then he dropped a seed here or there, for he
had a handful of them; sometimes he threw one to the birds; again he
dropped one for the squirrels; and still again he would toss one into
the air for very play, for that was what he loved best.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that he passed by a spot where the earth lay bare, with
no tree or plant to cover its brown breast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" said the child. "Poor place, will nothing grow in you? here is a
seed for you, and now I will plant it properly."</p>

<p>So he planted the seed properly, and smoothed the earth over it, and
went his way singing, and looking at the white clouds in the sky and at
the green things unfolding around him.</p>

<p>It was a long, long journey the child had to go. Many perils beset his
path, many toils he had to overpass, many wounds and bruises he got on
the way. When he returned, one would hardly have known, to look at him,
that he was still a child. The day had been cruelly hot, and still the
afternoon sun beat fiercely down on the white road. His clothes were
torn and dusty; he toiled on, and sighed as he went, longing for some
spot of shade where he might sit down to rest.</p>

<p>Presently he saw in the distance a waving of green, and a cool shadow
stretching across the white glowing road: and he drew near, and it was a
tree, young and vigorous, spreading its arms abroad, mantled in green
leaves that whispered and rustled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>Thankfully the child threw himself down in the pleasant shade, and
rested from his weary journey; and as he rested, he raised his eyes to
the green whispering curtain above him, and blessed the hand that
planted the tree.</p>

<p>The little green leaves nodded and rustled, and whispered to one
another:</p>

<p>"Yes! yes! it is himself he is blessing. But he does not know, and that
is the best of all!"</p>

<p>A youth stood in the doorway of his house and looked out upon the road
he was to travel.</p>

<p>"Alas!" he said. "It is a rough and stony road, and I am far from
strong: also my feet are tender, and I cannot bear pain. How shall I
take this hard journey?"</p>

<p>Then, as he sighed and looked, he was ware of two coming towards him
with pick and mattock on their shoulders. Swiftly they came, and soon
they were at his side, fawning on him, and speaking in soft, wheedling
voices. Their faces were eager and servile, their eyes bright as flame.</p>

<p>"Dear youth," they said, "we are come to smooth the road for you. It is
our trade; look, we have our tools with us! Give us but leave and we
will work for you gladly, and ask no pay."</p>

<p>"What men are ye?" asked the youth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>"We are called Temptation and Opportunity," they answered; "but what
matters this name or that? we seek but to serve you. Rest you still, and
soon the way shall be clear before you."</p>

<p>So the youth went back into his house and set him down, and watched how
all day long the two toiled apart with mattock and pick, smoothing and
levelling, lifting stones out of the way, and hewing down brambles and
tangled trees. But at night he laid him down and slept: and then those
two ran speedily together, and with fierce looks and eager hands they
dug and howked a grave in the earth. Deep it was, and lay straight
across the road; yet so cunningly placed that it could not be seen till
one was close upon it.</p>

<p>Morning came, and the youth stood at his door again, and saw the way
clear and smooth before him, and the two bowing low, with smiling faces
and fawning hands stretched out.</p>

<p>"Come, good Master!" they cried. "Come, dear youth, and let us bring you
on your way!"</p>

<p>The sick child sat at his window and looked out on the summer world. He
was sad at heart, for pain racked him, and weakness held him still; but
yet he smiled, because that pleased his mother.</p>

<p>"I am of no use in the world," said the child to himself; "I am of less
worth than yonder broken bough that lies on the ground, for that at
least gives trouble to no one, and by and by it will make a fire to warm
some poor soul. But still I must smile, lest my mother should be sad."</p>

<p>Presently the old field mouse who lived over the way came out of her
house, with a tiny brown velvet bundle in her mouth. It was one of her
eight young ones, and she was taking it to a new place, for the mole who
was their landlord had turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span> them out. She had taken five of the
little ones to the new house, but now she was weary, and her jaws ached
sadly with holding the heavy little creatures.</p>

<p>"I cannot carry them all!" she said. "The rest must die, since it cannot
be helped."</p>

<p>Just then she looked up, and saw the child smiling at the window.</p>

<p>"Look!" she said to herself. "That child has been watching me. He smiles
with pleasure at the beauty of my young ones, but he has not seen the
prettiest one yet. It will never do to give up now; I must try again,
and let him see that there are eight, all the handsomest of their
family."</p>

<p>So she tried again, and brought all the eight in safety to their new
home.</p>

<p>By and by a horse came along the road, dragging a heavy load. He was
old, and his bones ached, and the collar hurt his neck.</p>

<p>"Why should I not give up," he said to himself, "and refuse to go on? my
master could only beat me, and he does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span> that as it is. If I were dead, I
should not feel the blows; why should I struggle further with this
burden?"</p>

<p>Just then he happened to lift his eyes, and saw the child smiling at the
window.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, "that child is smiling at me. He sees that I was once a
fine animal; he knows good blood when he sees it. Ah! if he had seen me
in my youth! But I can still show him something." And he arched his neck
proudly, and stepped out bravely, tossing his head, and the load came
more easily after him.</p>

<p>By and by a man passed by, walking slowly, with bent head and sorrowful
look. He had lost the treasure of his heart, and the whole world was
black about him. "Why should I live longer?" he said to himself. "I have
nothing to live for in this world of misery. Let me lie down and die; in
death I can at least forget my pain and the pain of others."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he lifted his eyes by chance, and saw the child smiling at
the window.</p>

<p>"Come!" said the man. "There at least is one happy heart; and he
smiles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span> as if he were glad to see me pass. He is a sick child, too,
pale and thin; I must not cast a shadow on his cheerful day. And indeed,
the sun is bright and warm, even if my joy be cold."</p>

<p>He smiled and nodded to the child, and the child nodded to him, and
waved his hand, and the man went on, carrying the smile warm at his
heart, and took up the burden of life again.</p>

<p>Now it was evening. The child was weary. His head drooped on his bosom,
and his eyes closed. Then his mother came, and lifted him from his
chair, and laid him in his little bed.</p>

<p>"God bless him!" she said softly. "He has had a happy day, for he is
smiling even in his sleep."</p>

stone.</p>

lifted him, and he rose to his feet; but the chains lay where they fell.</p>

<p>Once a Cake would go seek his fortune in the world, and he took his
leave of the Pan he was baked in.</p>

<p>"I know my destiny," said the Cake. "I must be eaten, since to that end
I was made; but I am a good cake, if I say it who should not, and I
would fain choose the persons I am to benefit."</p>

<p>"I don't see what difference it makes to you!" said the Pan.</p>

<p>"But imagination is hardly your strong point!" said the Cake.</p>

<p>"Huh!" said the Pan.</p>

<p>The Cake went on his way, and soon he passed by a cottage door where sat
a woman spinning, and her ten children playing about her.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the woman, "what a beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span> cake!" and she put out her hand
to take him.</p>

<p>"Be so good as to wait a moment!" said the Cake. "Will you kindly tell
me what you would do with me if I should yield myself up to you?"</p>

<p>"I shall break you into ten pieces," said the woman, "and give one to
each of my ten children. So you will give ten pleasures, and that is a
good thing."</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be very nice, I am sure," said the Cake; "but if you
will excuse me for mentioning it, your children seem rather dirty,
especially their hands, and I confess I should like to keep my frosting
unsullied, so I think I will go a little further."</p>

<p>"As you will!" said the woman. "After all, the brown loaf is better for
the children."</p>

<p>So the Cake went further, and met a fair child, richly dressed, with
coral lips and eyes like sunlit water. When the child saw the Cake, he
said like the woman, "Oh, what a beautiful Cake!" and put out his hand
to take it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>"I am sure I should be most happy!" said the Cake. "And you will not
take it amiss, I am confident, if I ask with whom you will share me."</p>

<p>"I shall not share you with any one!" said the child. "I shall eat you
myself, every crumb. What do you take me for?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" cried the Cake. "This will never do. Consider my
size,&mdash;and yours! You would be very ill!"</p>

<p>"I don't care!" said the child. "I'd rather be ill than give any away."
And he fixed greedy eyes on the Cake, and stretched forth his hand
again.</p>

<p>"This is really terrible!" cried the Cake. "What is one's frosting to
this? I will go back to the woman with the ten children."</p>

<p>He turned and ran back, leaving the child screaming with rage and
disappointed greed. But as he ran, a hungry Puppy met him, and swallowed
him at a gulp, and went on licking his chops and wagging his tail.</p>

<p>"But it is school-time!" said the child.</p>

<p>"Sit down!" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"But father sent me on an errand!" said the child.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sit Down!</span>" said the Angel; and he took the child by her shoulders and
set her down.</p>

<p>"Now sit still!" he said, and he began patiently to wind up the skein.
It was wofully tangled, and knotted about the child's hands and feet; it
was a wonder she could move at all; but at last it was all clear, and
the Angel handed her the ball.</p>

<p>"I thank you so very much!" said the child. "I was not naughty, was I?"</p>

<p>"Not naughty, only foolish; but that does just as much harm sometimes."</p>

<p>"But I was doing right things!" said the child.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>"But you were doing them in the wrong way!" said the Angel. "It is good
to do an errand, and it is good to go to school, but when you have a
skein to wind you must sit still."</p>

<p>Yesterday, the kind nurse, Yesterday, the wise old woman, sat by the
fire with her nursling on her knee.</p>

<p>"Still, my babe, be still!" she said. "Listen now, till I sing you a
song!"</p>

<p>"Oh! I know all your songs," said the child. "I know them by heart, the
sleepy bed-time songs. But the lovely lady yonder, who smiles at me from
the doorway, sings a new song, new and strange, and sweet, sweet. If I
listen to her, may be I shall learn it."</p>

<p>"Nay! listen not to her, the gipsy!" said Yesterday. "Bide here by the
fire with me, my babe, and I will tell you a story shall do you good to
hear."</p>

<p>"Oh! I know all your stories," said the child, "know them every word,
and some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span> of them are false, and all are dull. But the lovely lady who
beckons me from the doorway murmurs strange words, in a new tongue, yet
clear as light; if I go with her, may be I shall learn it."</p>

<p>"Child, child," said the old nurse, "listen not to her gipsy talk; it is
full of peril, and these new words have wicked meanings. Come with me,
my darling, and I will show you my garden, full of sweet flowers and
delicate fruits and precious herbs. See! they have grown from all time,
and I gathered them from the four ways of the world, and all for you."</p>

<p>The child laughed, and his laugh rang cruel clear, as when a bird sings
loud and merry over a new-made grave.</p>

<p>"Your flowers are faded," he said. "I have tasted your fruits, every
one, and your precious herbs are but a handful of dry leaves and stalks.
But the lovely lady who holds out her hands to me from the doorway tells
me of things unknown, dim lands of furthest dawn, seas that no bark has
ever sailed. I will go with her and see them, and live my life."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay now, my child, my darling; stay with me by the fire, in the warm

<p>But the child was already gone, with To-morrow, the lovely lady with
sunrise in her eyes, laughter on her lips, and the knife hidden in her
hand.</p>

<p>All the morning the child ran about his field, smelling the sweet,
tasting the sweet, plucking the bright and gay; and as he plucked and
smelled and tasted, he found among the strawberries a dusky leaf that
was bitter in his mouth. "What is this?" he asked of the Angel beside
him; and the Angel said, "It is wormwood!"</p>

<p>"Pluck it all up!" cried the child. "It is bitter and hateful; I will
have nought in my field but strawberries and roses."</p>

<p>And the Angel smiled, with folded hands.</p>

<p>Noon came, and afternoon, with long rays sloping westward; and the child
walked in his field with slow and thoughtful steps. There were no
flowers now in the grass, but everywhere a dusky leaf with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span> dusky
berries; and the air was full of the fragrance of them, sweet and yet
bitter; bitter, yet oh, how sweet!</p>

<p>"What is this," the child asked, "that is bitter, and yet sweeter than
aught else in the world?"</p>

<p>"<i>Though I make my bed in Hell</i>...."</p>

<p>It was dark in the Pit. The air was heavy with poisonous vapors; the
walls were foul with the slime of uncounted generations; under foot was
the horror of the ages; yet still the man slept, for he was used to the
place, and his brain sodden with the fumes of it. But by and by, as he
slept, a sound crept into his ears, a weary, crying voice that went on
and on and would not still; till the man stirred uneasily in his sleep,
and awoke with the sound in his ears.</p>

<p>"Who is this," he said, "that breaks my slumber?"</p>

<p>He hearkened, and the voice went crying on:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! the blackness and the horror! oh! the dreadful, dreadful place!
will none help me out?"</p>

<p>"What ails you at the place?" asked the man. "One sleeps well enough, if
folk would but be quiet."</p>

<p>And the voice went clamoring on; the piteousness of it might have
stirred the dead things under foot.</p>

<p>"Oh! for one breath of God's pure air! for one glimpse of God's good
sunshine! Oh! the horror of it, to die in the foul dark! will none help
me out?"</p>

<p>Then the man looked, for his eyes were used to the mirk of the Pit, and
saw beside him the face of a youth, glimmering white as the dead moon at
midday, and shining with tears and sweat of agony; and the lad was
tearing at the walls, trying to make a way out; but his hands slipped on
the slimy stones, and he fell back moaning and crying.</p>

<p>"Here is a great ado!" said the man. "But if it goes so ill with you, I
will find a way out, if way there be."</p>

<p>He rose from the wallow where he lay,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span> and with his strong hands felt
along the walls, and found a crack between two great stones, and set his
strength to rend them apart; but they clung together like the lips of
Death. Long he struggled, yet could not stir them; and ever the doleful
voice beat like a bell in his ears, till it seemed to him that he must
give his life, so but that lad might go free.</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt a touch upon him, and in that same moment the stones
moving under his hand: and looking, he was ware through the glimmering
dark of another hand laid on the stone, and of one toiling beside him,
striving even as he strove. Then the man set all the strength that was
in him, and the great stones crumbled apart, and through the opening the
fresh wind blew and the sun shone.</p>

<p>Then those two, the man and he who had toiled beside him, lifted the
youth between them and brought him out into the open day; and the lad
cried out once more, sobbing now for pure joy, and kissed their hands
that had brought him out, and went singing on his way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>But the man stayed, and looked on that one who had toiled beside him.
"Oh!" he said, "it was you!"</p>

<p>"Who else?" said the other.</p>

<p>"But how came you there?" asked the man.</p>

<p>And the other answered, "I went in with you!"</p>

<p>Next day he met another friend, who was a physician.</p>

<p>"Do not stay me!" said the physician. "The case is urgent. I am going to

<p>The great Pot boiled and bubbled over the crackling flames. Fat and

together. "Hubble bubble!" said the Pot.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass after a time that a certain part of what was within
rose to the top, and mantled there, frothing and eddying.</p>

<p>"I am the cream!" it said. "This is my proper place, the top of the Pot.
Under me the mass seethes darkling, and from it I rise to light and air.

<p>"But you don't understand!" said the Soul. "It is my body that makes all
the trouble. Its nerves are all atwist, its brain does not work
properly, its heart is too small. <i>I</i> am all right: if I could have
another chance, in a decently furnished body, you would see what a
different creature I should be."</p>

<p>"Very well!" said the Angel-who-attends-to-things. "I know several other
souls who are wishing for a change; you may try their bodies, and see if
you can suit yourself."</p>

<p>The Soul thanked the Angel joyfully, and flew in the direction he
pointed out. Presently he came to the body of a fair woman, clad in
white, with roses in its hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p>"This is beautiful!" said the Soul. "This is exactly what I want." He
crept in, and flowed through the white body, and it moved and rose up
with him, and went to and fro.</p>

<p>But soon the Soul cried out: "Oh! this body pinches me; it is too tight.
Besides, it has the habit of fasting, and mortification, and I am used
to a body that smokes. This will never do!" And he crept out again, and
went further.</p>

<p>Presently he came to a stalwart body of a man, with bones and sinews
knit of iron.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Soul. "Beauty is after all a slight thing. Strength is
what one needs; this is the body for me." And he slipped in, and flowed
through the body, and it moved, and rose up with him, and walked with
swift and powerful strides.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" cried the Soul. "This will never do. This body is far
too big for me; I feel it all loose, and full of cold draughts. I shall
certainly get the rheumatism. And I don't care about these things it is
doing, hewing wood and carrying water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span> for other people. I have made a
mistake; let me correct it before it is too late!" and he crept out.</p>

<p>Going further, he came upon a body sunk in an easy-chair, clad in loose
and easy garb of a man, and by it a table with glasses and bottles: and
the Soul yearned toward it. "Ah!" cried the Soul. "After all, there is
nothing like one's own!" And he crept into the body, and flowed through
and through it; and the body stretched itself with a long, long sigh,
and put its hand out to the bottle, and drank, and chuckled to itself.</p>

<p>"But how about those others who wanted a change?" asked the Soul of the
Angel-who-attends-to-things. "I trust I am not disappointing any of them
in taking up this dear old comfortable body again?"</p>

<p>"Oh no!" said the Angel. "They did not like its looks at all, and
decided to go on to another world."</p>

<p>When it was time for the Child to have lessons, the Teacher-Angel gave
him a sheet of paper, smooth and white, and a pencil, and a ruler.</p>

<p>"Write as well as you can," he said; "and mind you keep the lines
straight!"</p>

said, "where I can see it always." So he put it up on the wall, and the
sunbeams, hardly brighter than itself, sparkled on it.</p>

beautiful in the world." And then he began his task.</p>

<p>By and by the lesson time was over, and the Teacher-Angel came to see
what had been done. The Child showed him the paper on which he had
written his task. Up and down went the lines, here and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span> there, from side
to side of the sheet, which was covered with sprawling, straggling
letters. There were smudges, too, where he had tried to rub something
out; it was not a pretty page.</p>

<p>"What is this?" asked the Teacher-Angel. "Where is your ruler?"</p>

world-shadows this many a year. Who should bear the torch but he?"</p>

side, and his eyes looked downward, remembering; and no torch was in his

way, and now it sounded loud in my ears.</p>

the keeper of the gates of God!"</p>

and stumbled on the rough stones, for the great torch hung heavy in her
hand, and heavy the babe on her arm: but he sat there as on a throne,

making, yet they served to hold meal and milk, and the poor folk bought
of him. But ever, as he shaped the clay, the potter said to himself:
"Some day, some day, I will make a cup of gold for the Prince's

<p>Now and again, when he was well paid for his pots, he would get a bit of

enough. Then he left his clay, and with care and loving pains, his lathe

<p>Once an Angel found a child crying bitterly, and stopped to comfort him.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, dear?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"Oh, I have hurt myself dreadfully!" said the child. "Dreadfully! see!"
and he showed his wound.</p>

<p>"Yes, that must have hurt very much, I know," said the Angel; "but cheer
up! I knew another child who was wounded in the same place, and he got
over it in good time."</p>

<p>"Ah! but it was not so bad a wound as mine!" said the child.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was," said the Angel; "every bit as bad."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>"But it did not hurt him so much!" said the child.</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"Because he wasn't me!" said the child.</p>

<p>Three men came to Love the Lord, asking a gift of his white fire, and
the gift was not denied. "Take it, keep it, use it!" said Love the Lord;
and they answered joyfully, "Yea, Lord, this will we do!"</p>

<p>Then the three fared forth on their way, the old way, and the new way,
and the only way; yet they went not together, but each by himself alone.</p>

<p>Presently one came to a dark valley, full of men who groped with their
hands, seeking the way, and finding it not, for they had no light; and
they moaned, and cried, "Oh! that we had light, to show us the way!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>Then that man answered aloud, "Yea, and there shall be light!"</p>

<p>And he took the fire that was given him of Love the Lord, and made of it
a torch, and held it aloft, and it flashed through the darkness like a
sword, and showed the way; and he leading, they following, they came
safe through that place into the light of day.</p>

<p>The second man went by another path of the way, and it led him over a
bleak moor, where the wind blew bitter keen, and the rocks stood like
frozen iron; and here were men shivering with cold, huddling together
for warmth, yet finding none, for they had no fire. And they moaned, and
cried, "Ah! if we had but fire to keep the life in us, for we perish!"</p>

<p>And the man said, "Yea, there shall be fire!"</p>

<p>And he took the fire that he had of Love the Lord, and spread it out,
and set faggots to it, and it blazed up broad and bright; and the folk
gathered round it, and held out their hands and warmed themselves at it,
and forgot the bitter wind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>Now the third man went his way also; and as he went he said to himself,
"How shall I keep my fire safe, that no fierce wind blow it out, and no
foul vapor stifle it? I know what I will do; I will hide it in my heart,
and so no harm can come to it." And he hid the fire in his heart, and
carried it so, and went on.</p>

<p>Now by and by those three came to the end of the way, and there waited
for them one in white, and his face veiled. He said to the first man,
"What of your fire?"</p>

<p>And the man said, "I found folk struggling in darkness, and I made a
torch of my fire, and showed them the way; now is it well-nigh wasted,
yet still it burns."</p>

<p>And he in white said, "It is well; this fire shall never die."</p>

<p>Then came the second, and of him, too, that one asked, "What of your
fire?"</p>

<p>And he said, "I found men shivering, with nought to warm them, and I
gave my fire, that they might live, and not die."</p>

<p>And he in white answered again, "It is well; this fire too shall never
die."</p>

<p>Then came the third, and answered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span> boldly, and said, "I have brought my
fire safe, through peril and through strife; lo, see it here in my
heart!"</p>

<p>Then that one in white put aside his veil; and it was Love the Lord
himself. "Alas!" he said; "what is this you have done?"</p>

<p>And he opened the man's heart; and inside it was a black char, and white
ashes lying in it.</p>

<p>This one Love the Lord called to him, and waited no asking, but put the
gift in her hands, the white gift of fire.</p>

<p>"What shall I do with it, Lord?" she asked: and he said, "Lighten the
darkness!"</p>

<p>"Yea, Lord," she answered, "as I may!" and took the gift meekly and
went. But as she went, she met one strong and silent, who took her in
his arms, and bore her to a high tower, and kept her there in ward. The
name of that strong one was Pain, and he was faithful as Night and
Death, and they two dwelt together.</p>

<p>But she in the tower tended ever the white fire, and wept over it,
saying, "How,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span> in this tower, shall I do the will of Love the Lord,
seeing here are only my fellow Pain and I? and the tower is full of
seams and cracks, so that the wind blows cold upon my fire, and would
fain quench it; and in no case can I lighten any darkness save my own."</p>

<p>But still she tended the fire and kept it alive; pure and white was the
flame of it, and she and her fellow Pain sat beside it and kept them
warm.</p>

<p>But Love the Lord looked from the clearness where he dwelt, and smiled;
well pleased was he. For he saw through the seams and rents in that
doleful tower the light stream clear and radiant: and in the darkness
toward which his high heart yearned he saw men struggling forward, and
heard them cry to one another joyfully, "Look up! take heart! yonder
shines a light to guide us on the way."</p>

<p>"I have come to speak to you about your work," said the
Angel-who-attends-to-things. "It appears to be unsatisfactory."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said the man. "I hardly see how that can be. Perhaps you will
explain."</p>

<p>"I will!" said the Angel. "To begin with, the work is slovenly."</p>

<p>"I was born heedless," said the man. "It is a family failing which I
have always regretted."</p>

<p>"It is ill put together, too;" said the Angel. "The parts do not fit."</p>

<p>"I never had any eye for proportion," said the man; "I admit it is
unfortunate."</p>

<p>"The whole thing is a botch," said the Angel. "You have put neither
brains nor heart into it, and the result is ridiculous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span> failure. What do
you propose to do about it?"</p>

<p>"I credited you with more comprehension," said the man. "My faults, such
as they are, were born with me. I am sorry that you do not approve of
me, but this is the way I was made; do you see?"</p>

<p>"I see!" said the Angel. He put out a strong white hand, and taking the
man by the collar, tumbled him neck and crop into the ditch.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this?" cried the man, as he scrambled out
breathless and dripping. "I never saw such behavior. Do you see what you
have done? you have ruined my clothes, and nearly drowned me beside."</p>

<p>"Oh yes!" said the Angel: "this is the way <i>I</i> was made."</p>

ugly pictures, so that when you come to see ugly things you may know
what they are. Look! see this, how hateful it is; and this, how hideous;
and here again, this, enough to turn one cold with horror."</p>

me more!"</p>

<p>The white frost struck my garden, and blighted my flower of joy. Oh! it
was fair, and all the sweetness of the spring breathed from its cup; but
now it lay blackened and withered, and my heart with it.</p>

<p>Then, as I stood mourning, I heard another crying voice; and looking up
I saw my neighbour in her garden, bending over her stricken plants and
weeping sore. I hastened to her. "Take courage!" I said. "It may be they
are not quite dead: for, look! here lingers a little green along the
leaves. Look here again, the sap flows. Take heart, and we will work
together, you and I."</p>

<p>So I labored, and she with me, binding up, tending and watering, night
and day;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span> till at last life came back to her plants, first faltering,
then flowing free, and they held up their heads and drank the sunshine,
and opened fair and sweet to the day.</p>

<p>Then, with her blessing warm at my heart, I turned me homeward: and oh!
and oh! in the ruined garden where all lay black and prone, a thread of
green creeping, a tiny bud peeping, a breath of spring upon the air.
Glad woman, I fell upon my knees, and stretched out trembling hands to
where, faint and feeble, yet alive, bloomed once more my flower of joy.</p>

<p>Some neighbours were walking together in the cool of the day, watching
the fall of the twilight, and talking of this and that; and as they
walked, they saw at a little distance a light, as it were a house on
fire.</p>

<p>"From the direction, that must be our neighbour William's house," said
one. "Ought we not to warn him of the danger?"</p>

<p>"I see only a little flame," said another; "perchance it may go out of
itself, and no harm done."</p>

<p>"I should be loth to carry ill news," said a third; "it is always a
painful thing to do."</p>

<p>"William is not a man who welcomes interference," said a fourth. "I
should not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span> like to be the one to intrude upon his privacy; probably he
knows about the fire, and is managing it in his own way."</p>

<p>A plant grew up in the spring, and spread its leaves and looked abroad,
rejoicing in its life.</p>

<p>"To grow!" said the plant. "To be beautiful, and gladden the eyes of
those who look on me: this is life. The Giver of it be praised!"</p>

<p>Now the plant budded and blossomed: lovely the blossoms were, and sweet,
and men plucked them joyfully.</p>

<p>"This is well!" said the plant. "To send beauty and fragrance hither and
thither, to sweeten the world even a little, this is life: the Giver of
it be praised!"</p>

<p>Autumn came, and the plant stood lonely, yet at peace. "One cannot
always be in blossom!" it said. "One has done what one could, and a
little is part of the whole."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>By and by came a gatherer of herbs, and cut the green leaves from the
plant. "They are good for bruises," he said; "or distilled, their juice
may heal an inward wound."</p>

<p>The plant heard and rejoiced. "To heal!" it said. "That is even better
than to gladden the eyes. The Giver of this too be praised!"</p>

<p>Now it was winter. The dry stalk stood in the field, and crackled with
the frost, its few remaining leaves clinging black and shrivelled about
it.</p>

<p>"All is over now," said the plant. "There must be an end to everything."</p>

<p>But now came a poor soul shivering with the cold, and took the dry plant
and carried it to his home; and breaking it in pieces, laid the
fragments on his naked hearth and set fire to them. Puff! the dry stalks
crackled into flame and blazed up merrily, filling the room with light
and warmth.</p>

<p>"And is this death?" said the plant. "The Giver of all be praised!"</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
